# David's PiPico Repo

A general dumping ground for all of the Pico / RP2040 crap I'm playing with.

Sometimes they may even work.

* mp : MicroPython (sometimes using pimoroni libraries, sometimes not. Take a guess)
* cp : Adafruit Circuit Python
* cpp : c / cpp - can't imagine there'll be a hell of a lot in here
